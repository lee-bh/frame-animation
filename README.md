# Animation by
# RequestAnimationFrame();
This project demonstrates a simple frame animation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It cycles through a series of Material Design icons, displaying them one after another to create an animation effect. 

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:** Used for the basic structure of the web page (`index.html`).
*   **CSS:** Includes `normalize.css` to ensure consistent rendering across different web browsers.
*   **JavaScript:** Powers the animation logic, icon loading, and canvas drawing.

## File Descriptions

*   **`index.html`**: This is the main HTML file. It sets up the page structure, includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript files, and contains the `<canvas>` element where the animation is rendered.
*   **`bh.js`**: A utility library containing helper functions that might be used by the animation script or other JavaScript components.
*   **`mIcon.js`**: This file defines a JavaScript array named `mIcon`. This array holds a list of strings, where each string is the name of a Material Design icon. The animation script uses these icon names to render the corresponding icons.
*   **`normalize.css`**: This CSS file helps in making browser rendering more consistent by resetting or normalizing default styles. This reduces cross-browser inconsistencies.

## How to Run the Project

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser that supports HTML5 Canvas (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

The animation should start automatically, displaying a sequence of Material Design icons.
